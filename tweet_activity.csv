@anortcliffe @CCCUStudents So what we are saying CCCU student ambassadors for EDT are fantastic :-) #CCCUOpenDay
@anortcliffe @CCCUStudents On a #CCCUOpenDay busy is good. It was great to see visitors (and I hope future students) working in groups problem-solving an algorithm for how to open a bottle of pop.
@anortcliffe @CCCUStudents I really enjoyed seeing the student ambassadors very freely and enthusiastically showing the web development projects and AI work on the screen; and literally being fantastic ambassadors for the section.
"It was lovely working the computing student ambassadors today at the #CCCUOpenDay  it was especially great when they showed some of their work from previous years on the screens :-) We have good and talented students, who do interesting work. @CCCUStudents

@anortcliffe @KiuSum @HalaMansour @LTHEchat @profpeterbrad @Mark_g_dawson @suebecks But that is always a challenge - in a purely F2F it still happens. Technology though has the potential to widen the choice of ways to engage? #LTHEchat

@anortcliffe @LTHEchat @profpeterbrad @Mark_g_dawson @suebecks They love their Discord and I am fine with that.

@HalaMansour @LTHEchat @profpeterbrad @Mark_g_dawson @suebecks I know @anortcliffe has made the argument before on the hybrid approach is the way many organisations have been working for a while. So there is a employability skill gain in using the tools.
@anortcliffe Hi Anne
@profpeterbrad Which is perhaps a great argument for having it approved/supported for the Uni use? Not sure
